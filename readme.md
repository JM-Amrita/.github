Welcome to the code repo for the 6G Spectrum Tokenisation Project, a joint research initiative from Jupiter Meta and Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham.

#Research Objective:

	•	Develop a blockchain-based spectrum management system in Radio Access Networks (RAN) that dynamically and distributedly allocates spectrum resources.
	•	Incorporate spectrum tokenization to enable detailed sharing parameters, including frequency bands, spectrum lease duration, transmit power, and geolocation of secondary providers.
	•	Ensure compliance of spectrum-sharing blockchain transactions with Service Level Agreements (SLA) and regulatory standards, enabling auditability and reporting for regulatory oversight.
	•	Design an adaptive blockchain system for RAN that responds to real-time network conditions and demand, improving Quality of Service (QoS).
	•	Leverage AI and Machine Learning (ML) techniques to optimize spectrum allocation decisions, enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of resource management in dynamic network environments.
